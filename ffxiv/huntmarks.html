				<p class="ddp1">This is a curious mark. According to my sources, they hail from beyond Il Mheg's borders, and may well roam all across Norvrandt.</p>
				<p class="ddp1">It's a mean bastard, even for a wandering eater. We've received reports of it actively seeking out veteran hunters, as if it craves the thrill of the fight.</p>
				<p class="ddp1">Which isn't to say that it fights fair. Sadly, several of our top Nutters have been ambushed while returning home from a successful hunt, which has led some to wonder if it commands lesser minions to guide it to promising prey.</p>
				<p class="ddp1">As for who it was before it turned─some say it was an elven soldier who led others in open revolt against the rulers of Lakeland before the Flood, all at the behest of the mysterious Shadowkeeper, and that like the Virtues, its unusual hunting habits are rooted in its past life...</p>

				<p class="ddp1">When the doors of the tower that stands at the center of the Crystarium first opened, it is written that the Tyger came barreling forth like a shot from a cannon.</p>
				<p class="ddp1">But despite its grand entrance, it behaved little different than any other wild beast, devouring livestock and attacking hapless travelers. It rather likes meat, though it has a clear preference for poultry by all accounts.</p>
				<p class="ddp1">I can't say I entirely trust the accounts of its origin, but given its unusual appearance, I would be not at all surprised if it was indeed a creature come from another world.</p>

				<p class="ddp1">Well enough, I suppose, so long as they stick to their territory, but lately there's been talk of some coming into Lakeland. Don't believe me? Then how else can you explain the otherworldly horse seen loitering by the shore, attempting to lure curious folk into the water?</p>
				<p class="ddp1">'Tis none other than Nuckelavee. A Fuath wielding glamours, most like, though none can say for certain. What I can say for certain, though, is that if you killed the devil we'd all be better for it.</p>

				<p class="ddp1">I mean, it's a story about fair maidens growing on trees! As in you could walk right up to it and pluck 'em from the branches. Tell me that's not the stuff of dreams!</p>
				<p class="ddp1">On the other hand, every naturalist you ask will swear that it was nothing of the sort. That it was people spying upon a tribe of cannibals in the middle of their dinner who convinced themselves they couldn't possibly be seeing what they saw. Me, I prefer the tree explanation myself, but...</p>

				<p class="ddp1">The guard have their work cut out for them keeping the local fauna in check, but they manage well all things considered. However, there's one mark that continues to be a nuisance.</p>
				<p class="ddp1">The Ronka called it Itzpapalotl, a butterfly or some such that feasts on the blood of the living.</p>
				<p class="ddp1">You might scoff at the thought that a butterfly could be so dangerous, but know this: that butterfly once attacked a Crystarium outpost and claimed the lives of several good men and women. Do not underestimate the butterfly.</p>

				<p class="ddp1">Understand he's not some rabid, uncontrollable beast, though. He's quick and cunning─able to size up an opponent and go to ground if he thinks he's overmatched.</p>
				<p class="ddp1">More than few foolish Nutters made the mistake of pursuing him like any other common prey...and paid the ultimate price for it. One of them was the fiancée of a friend of mine. Vengeance was sworn, as you'd expect, but I'd rather have you spare him the trouble.</p>

				<p class="ddp1">You can imagine how that worked out for him in the end. One day he up and vanished, and a short while after, an eater wearing his face appeared.</p>
				<p class="ddp1">For all his faults, his loss was felt keenly. He helped many with his magicks─powerful spells that utilized yarn he spun himself as catalysts. But I don't suppose eaters have much call for spinning yarn, do they...</p>

				<p class="ddp1">Familiars such as these are usually sustained by the aether of their master, which is why when they fall in battle, their minions fall as well. There are, however, certain notable exceptions.</p>
				<p class="ddp1">Ran'jit's father commanded a familiar as well, but when he was slain by a sin eater, Huracan somehow survived, and has been seen on several occasions since. One theory posits that since the master was transformed into an eater, the familiar endures, though it is no more than conjecture...</p>

				<p class="ddp1">They're clever enough to use tools, but they lack patience and foresight. You'll never catch them plowing a field, to say the least. Building's not in their nature─but thievery and destruction, they most certainly are.</p>
				<p class="ddp1">Li'l Murderer, as some have taken to calling him, is perhaps the worst of the lot. A liar and a scoundrel who has swindled countless innocents, relieving them of their worldly possessions and often their lives as well. He is a cunning fiend and is not to be underestimated.</p>

				<p class="ddp1">Apparently, it's an automaton the Goggs originally built for mining that malfunctioned and has since been attacking anything and everything that moves.</p>
				<p class="ddp1">Considering this spat I hear's been going on between the dwarven factions for a while now, I wouldn't be surprised if the malfunction was in truth sabotage...but regardless, a mark's a mark.</p>

				<p class="ddp1">On the whole, the beasts can be highly aggressive and territorial. Indeed, they drove away nearly all other competing species, and those they could they simply slaughtered. They've even been known to attack travelers and residents of Gatetown.</p>
				<p class="ddp1">At this rate, I shouldn't be surprised if they march on Wright en masse. And so before it comes to that, we believe we should teach these feathered menaces a lesson in respect, starting with their leader.</p>

				<p class="ddp1">The Brainy One is a saichaniae that plays host to parasitic vegetation that feeds off its host's aether. Poor bugger, eh? It's awfully difficult to track down, but it is said to be somewhat, er...excitable in the presence of death.</p>
				<p class="ddp1">I reckon it's anticipating the impending release of aether. Like if someone were to wave a freshly cooked haunch of mole meat under your nose.</p>
				<p class="ddp1">That said, not all deaths are created equal. The flashier the better, if that makes any sort of sense?</p>
				<p class="ddp1">Distance is key too, I'd imagine. No point in putting on a show if the host is nowhere nearby. Maybe something explosively loud, too? I don't know, you'll probably think of something if you put your mind to it.</p>
